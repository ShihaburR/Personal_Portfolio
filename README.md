  My Personal Portfolio
</h1>

This is a portfolio about me created from the Gatsby Starter default and using React-Bootstrap that is currently being deployed on Netlify.


## ðŸš€ What I used

1.  **Gatsby**

  Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the default starter. Then start creating JSX files (JS for React) that will         store information for each page, components and many more. I have so far components for the layout, header, seo (site data collection)   and navigation bar (in progress). I will also try to implement more features such as, fluid transitions, interactive buttons and many   more.

    ```sh
    # create a new Gatsby site using the default starter
    gatsby new my-default-starter https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default
    ```

2.  **React Bootstrap**

This is essentially a CSS framework recreated for React users that will allow me to add features I want to include on my website such as  navigation bar, a jumbotron, cards and spinners. You require to do a npm install for their modules.

```sh
    # Get started with React Bootstrap
    https://react-bootstrap.github.io/
    ```

**`LICENSE`**: Gatsby is licensed under the MIT license.
